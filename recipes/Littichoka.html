    <h1>Litti choka</h1>
    <img src="./images/Littichoka.jpg" width="300" height="200" alt="Description of the image">
    <p> Litti choka is a flavorful Indian dish hailing from Bihar and Jharkhand. It's a delightful combination of crispy, oven-baked wheat balls called litti, stuffed with a savory and spicy mixture of roasted chickpea flour (sattu). This earthy filling is balanced by a contrasting chokha, a mashed vegetable relish typically made with brinjal, potato, and tomato.
         The contrasting textures and vibrant flavors make litti choka a hearty and satisfying meal, best enjoyed hot with dollops of chutney or yogurt.</p>
